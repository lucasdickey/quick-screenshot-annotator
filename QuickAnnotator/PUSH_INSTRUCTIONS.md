# Push to GitHub - Final Steps

## Repository Configured ‚úÖ

Your project is configured to push to:
**https://github.com/lucasdickey/quick-screenshot-annotator**

## What You Need to Do

Since I can't authenticate with your GitHub account, you need to complete the push from your local machine.

### Step 1: Download the Project

The project is ready in: `QuickAnnotator/`

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

From your local machine, run:

```bash
cd QuickAnnotator
./push-now.sh
```

OR manually:

```bash
cd QuickAnnotator

# If using GitHub CLI (recommended)
gh auth login
git push -u origin main

# OR with Personal Access Token
git push -u origin main
# Username: lucasdickey
# Password: [your-personal-access-token]
```

## Authentication Options

### Option 1: GitHub CLI (Easiest)
```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
# Follow the prompts
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Personal Access Token
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "QuickAnnotator"
4. Select scope: **repo** (full control of private repositories)
5. Generate and copy the token
6. Use it as your password when pushing

## What's Ready to Push

```
‚úÖ 2 commits with all code
