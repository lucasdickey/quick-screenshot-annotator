## Phase 1 Complete ✅

All MVP features from PROJECT_SPEC.md Phase 1 are implemented:
- ✅ All core annotation features
- ✅ Clipboard integration
- ✅ Undo/redo system
- ✅ Backend history collection
- ✅ Manual font sizing (12pt default)

---

## Phase 2 - Future Enhancements

Features planned but not yet implemented:

### Planned Features
- [ ] History UI browser
- [ ] Auto-scaling font size based on image dimensions
- [ ] Screenshot keyboard shortcut interception (SHIFT+CMD+CTRL+4)
- [ ] Arrow annotations
- [ ] Additional color customization
- [ ] Export to file option
- [ ] Batch annotation support
- [ ] Custom keyboard shortcuts

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Font size** - Fixed at 12pt (manual sizing only)
2. **No file I/O** - Clipboard only (by design for v1)
3. **No screenshot interception** - Must use system screenshot tools
4. **History not visible** - Backend storage only, no UI browser yet
5. **Single annotation type** - No arrows, rectangles, etc. (v1)

### Minor Issues
- None currently identified

---

## Testing Status

### Manual Testing ✅
- [x] Basic workflow (paste → annotate → copy)
- [x] Circle creation and editing
- [x] Text creation and editing
- [x] Mode switching
- [x] Color selection
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Undo/redo
- [x] Delete annotations
- [x] Clear all with confirmation
- [x] Clipboard operations
- [x] Window management

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] Very large images (4K+)
- [ ] Very small images (<100px)
- [ ] Many annotations (100+)
- [ ] Rapid undo/redo
- [ ] Text with special characters
- [ ] Empty clipboard paste
- [ ] Multiple app instances

### Performance Testing
- [ ] 4K image annotation
- [ ] 50+ annotations rendering
- [ ] Undo/redo with full stack
- [ ] Memory usage over extended session

---

## Build Status

### Compilation ✅
- [x] All Swift files compile without errors
- [x] No warnings
- [x] Build script works
- [x] Xcode project configured

### Deployment ❓
- [ ] App bundle creation tested
- [ ] Code signing setup
- [ ] Distribution method decided

---

## Documentation Status ✅

- [x] PROJECT_SPEC.md - Complete specifications
- [x] README.md - Project overview and usage
- [x] GETTING_STARTED.md - Quick start guide
- [x] STATUS.md - Implementation tracking (this file)
- [x] Code comments in complex sections
- [x] Build instructions

---

## Success Criteria Evaluation

From PROJECT_SPEC.md:

1. ✅ **Speed test**: Launch → paste → 2 circles + 1 text → copy → paste in Slack **< 15 seconds**
2. ✅ **Visibility**: Annotations clearly visible on diverse backgrounds
3. ❓ **Stability**: No crashes with 4K images (needs testing)
4. ❓ **Performance**: Smooth 60fps interaction (needs verification on target hardware)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Testing Phase**
   - Run comprehensive edge case testing
   - Test on multiple MacOS versions
   - Performance benchmarking with large images

2. **Polish Phase**
   - Review UX for edge cases
   - Add tooltips/help text if needed
   - Optimize rendering performance

3. **Distribution Phase**
   - Set up proper app bundle
   - Code signing
   - Create installer or distribution method

4. **Phase 2 Planning**
   - Prioritize Phase 2 features
   - Design history UI mockups
   - Plan auto-scaling font algorithm
